## Research Question
   \begin{block}{Main question}
To what extent does the local availability of upper secondary schools that offer an Abitur pathway, compared to other secondary schools, affect housing prices in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW)?
\end{block}
- Goal: Estimating heterogeneity in the capitalization of secondary schools that offer the possibility to achieve higher educational outcomes.
- We assume that parents are willing to pay a premium for their homes, if a school lies within 2km at which their children can make an Abitur (Gymnasium or Gesamtschule)
- Therefore, we restrict our analysis on different types of secondary schools and exclude elementary schools

## Motivation
- School availability plays an important role in housing decisions.
- Previous studies have shown capitalization of school quality into housing prices, but evidence on differences across upper secondary school tracks is limited.
- However, the \textbf{magnitude of the effect may differ by school track} and most studies suffer from the endogeneity problem of hedonic price regressions.
- Germany’s multi-track secondary school system provides a unique setting to study differential capitalization effects across educational tracks.

## Tiebout sorting

- The decision-making process of residents include the availability and quality of provided public goods and services within a municipality 
- Under the assumption of perfect mobility, residents pick that community that exactly satisfies their preferences (tiebout1956-421)
- If such a community or municipality is not feasible, a perfect substitute (if existent) is to be chosen

## Theory

- Educational quality is an important part of the set of considered public goods, because quality schooling is often decisive in later life-outcomes (e.g. labor market opportunities, gained income, health etc.) 
- Shape the way in which parents sort into the housing market directly influencing the level of residentual segregation (Bayer et al. 2007)
- Ongoing debate, which dimension of education is valued by parents (outputs or learning environments containing sociodemographic composition) - Machin 2011

## Theory 2

- Households sort across boundaries generating differences related to neighborhood quality - in this case: Education
- Parents are willing to pay a premium for housing units nearby top-tier schooling networks (Jayantha 2015)

This capitalizes into the housing market via two mechanisms (La 2015):

- Wealthier households that care about school quality bid up prices within the walking zone of a school
- This may generate spillovers through changes in neighborhood composition

## Hypothesis

Based on the theoretical background, we expect the following results:

- Parents value the opportunity to achieve higher educational outcomes for their children (z.B. Hörnig & Schäfer 2025)
- Educational opportunities play a role in parents’ housing decisions
- Parents are therefore willing to pay a premium for houses near a secondary school offering the opportunity to obtain an *Abitur*

\begin{block}{Formal Hypothesis}
\[
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{\text{school}} & \text{(Estimated treatment effect):} & H_1 &: \beta_1 > 0
\end{aligned}
\]
\end{block}


## Institutional Context and Literature Insight
- In Germany, parents enjoy considerable freedom in choosing schools — especially at the secondary level.
- Although this weakens formal ties between residence and school assignment, it may \textbf{increase behavioral selection} into high-quality school areas.
    
   \begin{block}{Key Insight:}
    When school choice is flexible, households with strong school preferences are more likely to relocate to access better schools — reinforcing the link between school quality and housing prices. \parencite{bayer2007}
    \end{block}
    
- \textit{Implication:} School choice flexibility does not reduce capitalization — it may even \textbf{enhance} it through self-selection.

## Literature Insights (excerpt)
- UK: Strong capitalization of \textbf{primary school} performance into housing prices. \parencite{gibbons2003}
- US: Stronger price effects from \textbf{middle and high school} quality than from elementary schools.\parencite{sedgley2008}
- France: Secondary school quality capitalized more strongly in areas without \textbf{private school alternatives}. \parencite{fack2010}

\textit{School type matters for the strength of the housing price effect.}#

## Data and Variables
\textbf{Housing Data:}

- Geo-referenced listings of sales properties (e.g., ImmoScout).
- Variables: living space, number of rooms, year built, condition, etc.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{School Data}:

- Locations and types of schools (primary, Gymnasium, Gesamtschule, etc.)
- School quality measured by the \textbf{School Social Index (SSI)} — lower values indicate better schools.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Regional Data:}

- Includes information on neighborhood characteristics (e.g. income levels, migration rates etc.)


## Empirical Strategy
\begin{columns}[T] % [T] = top aligned
    \begin{column}{0.55\textwidth}
        We define spatial treatment zones to estimate the causal effect of upper secondary schools on housing prices using grid-cells:
    \end{column}

  \begin{column}{0.45\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{matching_ID.PNG}
    \end{column}
\end{columns}

- \textbf{Treatment-Zone} Grid-cells \textbf{within ca. 2 km} radius
- \textbf{Buffer zone:} within \textbf{1 km} are excluded to prevent spillover contamination
- \textbf{Untreated zone:} Grid-cells \textbf{more than 3 km} from any school
-  Houses that are exposed to different kinds of secondary schools at the same time (double-treated) are also excluded from the sample


## Identification Strategy
\textbf{Potential Outcome Model (POM):} following \cite{Rubin1974}
$$\ln(P_{ijt}) =
\begin{cases}
\ln(P_{1ijt}) & \text{if } D_i = 1, \\
\ln(P_{0ijt}) & \text{if } D_i = 0.
\end{cases}
\]
\noindent\textbf{where:}
\[
\begin{aligned}
\ln(P_{1ijt}) &:\ \text{Price of the house, when it lies in the treatment-zone}\\
              &\quad \text{near to a Gymnasium or Gesamtschule}.\\
\ln(P_{0ijt}) &:\ \text{Price of the house, when it would not have been 'exposed'}\\
              &\quad \text{to a school (counterfactual)}.
\end{aligned}$$
\begin{block}{Note}
Since the counterfactual is not observed, we use the most similar house
lying in the non-treated zone as a proxy for the counterfactual.
\end{block}


## Matching Strategy
Identification Assumption (CIA): $$ \ln(P_{0ijt}), \ln(P_{1ijt}) \;\perp\; D \;\big| X_i$$
\textbf{Estimation method:} We use \textbf{matching} on observable covariates to compare treated and untreated buildings:

- Building characteristics (e.g., floor area, construction year, amenities)
- Neighborhood characteristics (e.g., income, urbanity, regional fixed effects)

After successful matching, the treatment effect is estimated through the following equation \parencite{tchatoka2021}:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{\text{school}} 
&= \mathbb{E}\!\left[ \ln(P_{1ijt}) - \ln(P_{0ijt}) \,\middle|\, X_i \right] \\
&= \mathbb{E}\!\left[ \ln(P_{1ijt}) \,\middle|\, X_i, D = 1 \right]
  - \mathbb{E}\!\left[ \ln(P_{0ijt}) \,\middle|\, X_i, D = 0 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$


## Econometric Model (OLS Specification)
We estimate the following log-linear autoregressive hedonic regression for elementary and secondary schools each \parencite{lu2023}:

$$
\log(\text{P}_i)
= \alpha
+ \beta_1 \, D_i
+ \mathbf{X}_i' \boldsymbol{\gamma}
+ \mathbf{N}_i' \boldsymbol{\delta}
+ \text{FE}_{r(i)}
+ \varepsilon_i
$$

\textbf{Where:}

- log($P_i$): price of a building per $m^2$
- $\beta_1D_i$: Captures the effect of the treatment of the nearest upper secondary school
- $\mathbf{X}_i$: vector of building characteristics 
- $\mathbf{N}_i$: vector of neighborhood characteristics, includes the SSI for a proxy of the social composition
- $\text{FE}_{r(i)}$: Regional fixed effects to account for spatial effects at the grid-cell level
- $\varepsilon_i$: error term


## Assumptions
- The School Social Index (SSI) provides a reasonable proxy for neighborhood socio-economic composition, as it reflects the socio-economic background of students.
- Parents consider the availability of Abitur and non-Abitur upper secondary schools in their housing decisions.
- Within the treatment area and the control area, the effect is constant.
- Buildings inside and outside of the treatment zones share the same average housing and neighborhood characteristics.
- Conditional on the controlling for both housing and neighborhood characteristics, the treatment assignment can considered to be random.
- Sale prices are time-independently exceeding offer prices at a constant rate.


## Empirical Challenges and Limitations
- \textbf{Endogeneity:} better schools tend to be located in affluent neighborhoods and students endowed with those priviledged backgrounds generally achieve higher educational outcomes \parencite{fack2010}
- \textbf{Measurement:} SSI is an aggregate proxy and may not fully capture educational quality.
    \item \textbf{School access rules:} In some regions, school choice or private alternatives may weaken capitalization effects.
- \textbf{Interpretation:} It is arguably that property prices can be interpreted as the willingness to pay for amenities \parencite{jayantha2015} and therefore the difference between the groups as a premium for educational opportunities
- \textbf{Price validity:} Property prices from ImmoScout are \textit{asking prices} — not actual transaction prices. This has implications on the interpretations of the results and has to be taken into account.
